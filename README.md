## Project Objectives
1. Build an AI-powered chatbot capable of analyzing customer behavior and customer preference to deliver personalized product recommendations in real-time.
2. Create a dashboard for tracking chatbot performance and customer behavior insights, aiding in data-driven decision-making.

# Tool

7. **Run the application using Streamlit**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

## How to use Application
Once the application is running, you will see the following message:
```bash
ðŸ’¬ Product Recommendation Chatbot
Welcome! Please provide your Customer ID to start.
```
**Steps:**

1. **Enter the Customer ID:**
   - Customer IDs are obtained from the customer interaction dataset.
   - As an example, you can use `CUST1001`.\
   after entering the Customer ID, the chatbot will respond:
   ```bash
   Thank you! Customer ID 'CUST1001' has been verified. How can I assist you?
    ```

2. **Request Product Recommendations**
    - Example prompt: white shirt with friend
    - The chatbot will recommend up to 3 products along with Buy and Virtual Try On buttons.


## NOTES (IMPORTANT!)
This app is under development. For frist execute, it maybe will take a lot of time because 
the dataset is wrote to the chromadb. The product recommendation is not perfect because the tool used is still experimental.

The uploaded image and result from virtual try on will be saved on local, so take a look at your drive.
